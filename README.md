# Hydration-measurement-system-with-python-open-cv-
This program uses image processing to measure hydration level of the user using  urine image. This program uses opencv library for python for image processing.
This code will take image as input from users and then convert the file type of the image to HSC format. Then it will give the hydration level of the user based on the hsv value of the image. This program uses open cv for image processing and uses tkinter to create a simple ui for the system.
